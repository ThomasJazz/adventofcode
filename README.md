I don't use golang for work but am interested in learning it, so this is a fun way for me to do that. I Also enjoy the daily puzzles so I will keep participating in AoC as long as I have time to do so. 

*These solutions will not be perfect or maybe even optimal, but that's okay because it's just for fun!*
